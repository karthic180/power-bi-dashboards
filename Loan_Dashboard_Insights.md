Loan Portfolio Dashboard — Key Insights 
This document summarizes the major insights from the loan analytics dashboard, covering borrower characteristics, loan drivers, lender risk, and emerging trends.

 Portfolio Overview
Total Loans: ~255K

Total Defaults: ~30K

Overall Default Rate: 11.61%

Defaults represent a meaningful share of the portfolio, with clear patterns across demographics, credit factors, and loan terms.

 Borrower Characteristics
1. Education Level
Default counts are highest among High School and Bachelor’s degree holders.

PhD and Master’s borrowers show the lowest default volumes, indicating stronger repayment behavior.

2. Employment Type
Unemployed borrowers have the highest default rate.

Full-time employment is associated with the lowest default risk.

Self-employed borrowers show elevated risk compared to full-time and part-time workers.

3. Marital Status
Single borrowers show higher default counts.

Married borrowers tend to have lower default rates.

Divorced borrowers fall in the middle.

4. Income Level
Low-income borrowers default significantly more often.

High-income borrowers show minimal default activity.

Default rate decreases steadily as income increases.

5. Credit Score Band
Poor credit scores correlate with the highest default counts.

Excellent credit borrowers show minimal defaults.

Clear inverse relationship: higher credit score → lower default rate.

 Loan Drivers
1. Loan Purpose
Default distribution varies by purpose:

Education and Other categories show higher default counts.

Home and Auto loans show lower default rates.

Loan purpose is a strong predictor of repayment behavior.

2. Loan Amount
Higher loan amounts (≥20k) show higher default rates.

Mid-range loans (10k–19.9k) show moderate risk.

Smaller loans (<10k) have the lowest default share.

3. Loan Term
Longer terms (37–60 months) have higher default rates.

Shorter terms (≤36 months) show better repayment performance.

4. DTI Ratio (Debt-to-Income)
Default risk increases sharply as DTI rises.

Borrowers with DTI < 20% show the lowest default rates.

5. Interest Rate
Higher interest rates correlate with:

Higher loan amounts for non-defaulted loans.

Higher default counts at elevated rate levels.

Suggests risk-based pricing is in effect but may not fully offset risk.

 Lender Risk Indicators
High-Risk Borrower Profile
Borrowers are more likely to default if they have:

Poor credit score

Low income

High DTI

Unemployment or unstable employment

Long loan terms

High interest rates

Education or “Other” loan purposes

Low-Risk Borrower Profile
Borrowers are less likely to default if they have:

Excellent credit

High income

Full-time employment

Short loan terms

Auto or home loan purposes

 Trends & Patterns
1. Credit Score vs Default Rate
Strong negative correlation: as credit score improves, default rate drops.

2. Income vs Default
Income is one of the strongest predictors of default likelihood.

3. Loan Term & DTI
Longer terms and higher DTI ratios consistently increase default risk.

4. Purpose-Based Risk
Education loans show disproportionately high default counts relative to volume.

 Summary
The dashboard reveals a clear set of risk drivers:

Borrower stability (income, employment, marital status)

Financial health (credit score, DTI)

Loan structure (term length, interest rate, loan amount)

Purpose of borrowing
