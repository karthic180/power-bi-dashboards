  - By Resource Group
- **Billable vs Non‑Billable Counts**: Distribution across resource groups.

##  Usage

This dataset can be used to:
- Track workforce utilisation trends.
- Compare billable vs non‑billable efficiency.
- Identify cost drivers by country or resource group.
- Support project cost allocation and forecasting.

##  How to Extend

- Add new timesheet data to expand utilisation analysis.
- Integrate with BI tools (Power BI, Tableau) for interactive dashboards.
- Use scripts to calculate KPIs like **average hourly cost per country** or **billable ratio per resource group**.

##  Notes

- Data is anonymized (employees listed as `Employee-XXX`).
- Costs are sample values in USD.
- Visualizations included are static snapshots; interactive slicers are referenced but not functional in this markdown.
