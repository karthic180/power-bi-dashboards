# AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases an **end-to-end Power BI solution built using the AdventureWorks dataset**, designed to demonstrate enterprise-style **data modelling, DAX proficiency, and business-focused reporting**.

The report simulates a real-world commercial analytics use case, covering **Internet and Reseller sales**, customer behaviour, product performance, geographic trends, and time intelligence. The focus is on building a **scalable semantic layer** with reusable measures and clear separation between fact and dimension tables.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a clean **star-schema data model** with multiple fact tables
* Create a reusable **semantic layer** using DAX measures
* Deliver insights tailored to different business audiences
* Apply advanced concepts such as **time intelligence**, **currency conversion**, and **many-to-many relationships**

---

## 🧱 Data Model

### Fact Tables

* **FactInternetSales** – Online customer sales (B2C)
* **FactResellerSales** – Reseller and wholesale sales (B2B)
* **FactCurrencyRate** – Exchange rates by date and currency

### Dimension Tables

* **DimDate** – Calendar and fiscal date attributes (marked as Date table)
* **DimCustomer** – Customer demographics and attributes
* **DimProduct** – Product details
* **DimProductSubcategory** / **DimProductCategory** – Product hierarchy
* **DimSalesTerritory** – Geographic and regional hierarchy
* **DimCurrency** – Currency codes and descriptions
* **DimSalesReason** – Reason for sale (via bridge table)

### Modelling Approach

* One-to-many relationships from dimensions to fact tables
* Single-direction filter flow to avoid ambiguity
* Shared dimensions across multiple fact tables
* Many-to-many relationship handled via a bridge table for Sales Reason

This approach ensures **performance, clarity, and scalability**.
