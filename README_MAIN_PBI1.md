## **Video Game Sales – Microsoft Fabric**

[![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Power%20BI-F2C811?style=flat&logo=powerbi&logoColor=black)](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)  
[![Fabric Dataflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fabric%20Dataflow-0078D4?style=flat&logo=microsoft&logoColor=white)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/)  
[![Lakehouse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lakehouse-4285F4?style=flat&logo=googlecloud&logoColor=white)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/)

This project demonstrates **end-to-end analytics** using **Microsoft Fabric Dataflow Gen 2**, **Lakehouse**, and **Power BI**.  
The workflow transforms raw Excel data into clean tables, then builds dashboards with **DAX, KPIs, and interactive visuals**.

###  Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – [Video Game Sales with Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jkraak/lego-sets-and-themes-database)  
- Format: Excel (`.xlsx`)  
- Key columns: `Name`, `Platform`, `Publisher`, `Year_of_Release`, `Genre`, `Global_Sales`, `NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, `JP_Sales`, `Other_Sales`

###  Tools & Technologies
**Primary Stack**: Power BI | Fabric Dataflow | Lakehouse  
**Supporting Tools**: SQL (PostgreSQL / T-SQL) | Power Query / M | DAX  

###  Dataflow Process (Single Node)
1. **Source:** Upload raw Excel file to Fabric  
2. **Transformations:**  
   - Remove duplicates  
   - Fill / replace nulls (`0` numeric, `"Unknown"` text)  
   - Change column types (Text, Whole Number, Decimal)  
   - Optional calculated columns: `Revenue = Global_Sales * 1_000_000`  
3. **Output:** Lakehouse table (`FactSales`)  
4. **Schedule:** Daily / weekly refreshes  
5. **Monitor:** Check run history for success/errors  

> All ETL done inside **one Dataflow node**.

###  Power BI Dashboard

**Key Visuals:**  
- Total Global Sales over time  
- Sales by Platform, Genre, Publisher  
- Market share by region  
- Top-selling games / platforms  

**DAX Measures Examples:**

```DAX
-- Total Global Sales
Total_Global_Sales = SUM(FactSales[Global_Sales])

-- Revenue in USD
Total_Revenue = SUM(FactSales[Revenue])

-- Average Sales per Game
Avg_Global_Sales = AVERAGE(FactSales[Global_Sales])
````

###  How to Reproduce

1. Upload raw Excel to Fabric
2. Create Dataflow Gen 2 node → apply cleaning, deduplication, type changes, calculated columns
3. Output → Lakehouse table
4. Open Power BI Desktop / Pro → connect to Lakehouse
5. Build dashboards using DAX and KPIs
6. Optional: schedule refreshes

### Key Takeaways

* Single Dataflow node handles full ETL
* Lakehouse stores clean, reusable data
* Power BI dashboards leverage DAX, KPIs, and visuals
* Scalable workflow for other datasets

```
